# AquaticDiscord

> [!TIP] 
> ## An auto discord account and token creator. The generator creates unlocked Discord tokens, and has an optional option to email verify them (free of cost) using a private GMail API. All of the tokens are unlocked and can be used for Mass DMing and other purposes. The generator is very fast, generating tokens up to 1,000 / second and works best with datacenter proxies. It uses a variety of factors to achieve this such as anti TLS fingerprinting, solving cloudflare challenges to bypass hCaptcha's anti bot detection, and more!
